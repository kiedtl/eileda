This is an experimental slideshow program built for personal use, inspired by
100r's adelie.

I created this mostly because I'm attracted to the idea of extremely simple,
barebones presentation software, such as suckless' sent or adelie, but would
still like some highly advanced/exotic typesetting capabilities (like bold
text).

Also, because Biden has mandated that all software engineers must either produce
a static site generator, or a presentation app, at some point in their life.
